== Introduction ==
Maze Runner is a hybrid controller for the Formula Allcode Robot Buggy that
combines low-level reactive behaviours and higher level deliberative behaviours
to safely map and navigate a 4x4 maze.  

== Installation ==

* Ensure the two scripts 'compile.sh' and 'load.sh' are executable,
(if not try chmod u+x)

* First run 'compile.sh' to generate the .bin and .hex file needed for
the robot's bootloader

* Then, ensuring the robot's bootloader is active by pressing the 'reset' button,
run the script 'load.sh'.
